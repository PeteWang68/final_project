<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>In the past recent years, the United States has been facing clashes of opinions and ideals, dividing the citizens within the country. We believe the increase in discriminative sentiments and conflicts between groups(races, ethnicities, sexual orientation, etc.) could be due to the election of Donald Trump as President, and the resulting shift in political power.</p>
<p>We sought to determine just how much these divisions within subgroups have increased through an analysis of hate crimes committed in the country. Hate crimes- crimes motivated by ethnic, racial, sexual, or other prejudices- would be a good indicator since they are directly related to these clashing ideals and divisions. Our goal is to see how hate crimes have changed over the years and determine its relationship to various predictors including political support.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>We were inspired to conduct this analysis after reading an article by USA Today that stated that hate crimes in 2017 increased in America’s ten largest cities. The article can be found here: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/07/17/hate-crimes-up-america-10-largest-cities/776721002/" class="uri">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/07/17/hate-crimes-up-america-10-largest-cities/776721002/</a></p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>There were several questions that we wanted to find out.<br />
Did hate crimes increase over the past decade? Was this change in part due to the change in the U.S. presidency? How do hate crimes differ by state? Did questions change as we did this project</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>We first created a dataset containing the number of hate crime incidents and offenses from 2005 to 2017 by compiling the yearly hate crime data from the FBI data source (the links to the datasets are provided below). We excluded the number of victims and known offenders also offered by these datasets, since they were not releveant to our analysis.</p>
<p>Then we created a dataset containing the annual hate crime rate for each state from 2005 to 2017. This was done by compiling data from the FBI data source and extracting the total number of hate crime incidents and the total population for each state. These values were then used to calculate the hate crime rate (per 100,000 people) by dividing the total incident count by the total population and then multiplying by 100,000. The cleaning portion for this dataset involved converting the list files to tidy data frames and renaming the year column. In the process of tidying the raw data, some columns were split into two columns resulting in NA’s for some values. We resolved this issue by converting the NA’s to 0 and then combining the split columns back into one column.</p>
<p>Next, to create a model for predicting the level of hate crime, we created a dataset composed of possible predictors. The dataset was created by compiling raw data from various sources that included the following predictors for the year 2016: median income, proportion of people with a high school degree, unemployment rate, proportion of non-citizens, proportion of white citizens, proportion of Trump voters. For the hate crime rate dataset, the rate was calculated again by taking the total hate crime incidents for 2016 and dividing by the total population and multiplying by 100,000. Each compiled raw dataset were cleaned for names and the location and the corresponding statistic of interest were extracted. These datasets were then merged to create compiled dataset consisting of states, their respective hate crime rates, and various predictors. Lastly, this dataset was finalized by cleaning its variables, such as removing the $ symbol from some values, and converting the median household income variable to numeric.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>We first created a simple plot to see how hate crimes in the U.S. changed from 2005 to 2017. This was done by aggregating the yearly hate crime reports and creating a line chart that depicting the total number of hate crime incidences over the specified timeline. We used the incidence counts for simplicity, since there could be multiple offenses commited per incident.</p>
<p>Next we found there was a change from 2016 to 2017 when it was the time for the election. We compare the hate crime rate for 10 days after the election(from 11.09.2016 - 11.18.2016) to the annual crime rate of 2016. This shows a great change. So we then change to see the relationship with share of the vote for Trump and the hate crime rate by state.</p>
</div>
<div id="additional-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Additional Analysis</h2>
<p>We performed a multilinear regression to see if predictors including</p>
<p>potential limits: all variables might be correlated with each other. data might not reflect actual hate crimes (not reported, reported falsely)</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The line plot depicting the total hate crime incidence counts from 2005 to 2017 showed a wave-like pattern, decreasing from 2008 to 2014 and increasing from 2014 to 2017. There was a spike in the number of hate crimes from 2016 to 2017, potentially caused by Trump’s election to Presidency at the end of 2016. We decided to look into this increase by comparing each state’s share of Trump voters to the change in its hate crime rate before and after Trump was elected.</p>
